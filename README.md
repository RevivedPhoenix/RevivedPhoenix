# Hi, I'm Ekaterina Bratchik! ðŸ‘‹ 

## ðŸš€ About Me
Iâ€™m a data analyst from Minsk, Bealrus.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an app that collects weather data for the last year and uses that data to predict the weather for the coming days.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning new tools and approaches for working with data.
- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaboration on interesting projects!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: kbratchik@bk.ru
- ðŸ˜„ Every detail is important and I strive for maximum accuracy in interpreting data.
- âš¡ Fun fact: my interest in data analysis was born from my passion for board games. One day, while learning the rules of a new board game, I discovered that the principles of optimizing moves and choosing the best strategies were so similar to my approaches to data analysis that it inspired me to pursue a career in analytics.

## Personality traits and hobbies
In addition to my deep interest in data analysis, I actively develop my personal qualities through various hobbies:

- ðŸ§— **Sports:** Regular exercise helps me maintain discipline, improve my physical fitness, and develop perseverance, which is important when solving complex analytical problems.
- ðŸŽ² **Board Games:** Playing board games develops strategic thinking and the ability to work together, which directly affects my approach to analyzing and interpreting data.
- ðŸ“š **Reading Books:** Reading helps broaden my horizons and deepen my analytical skills, stimulating the search for unconventional solutions and ideas.
